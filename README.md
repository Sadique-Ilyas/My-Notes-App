# <u>Notes App</u>

## INTRODUCTION

#### As the name of this app says 'Notes', this is a simple app which is generally used to store regular basis short notes. If a person want to store some information quickly (like phone numbers, website, person info or some other text) which they don't want to forget, they can save it here and can find it later on this app.

## MATERIAL USED

- #### IDE - Android Studio is used for the development of this app
- #### Programming Language - Java is basically used to write the whole logic and to perform all the functionalities in this app. XML is aslo used to design the whole UI of the app

## WORKING
#### This is a note taking app, built by using the Android Architecture Component libraries (Room, ViewModel, LiveData and LifeCycle), a RecyclerView and Java.
- #### Room is a database layer on top of an SQLite database, which makes it a Room Database. Room takes care of mundane tasks that we used to handle with an SQLiteOpenHelper . 
- #### ViewModel is used to model the gui
- #### LiveData is used to update the gui lively, i.e. immediately as a operation occurs
- #### Recycler View is used to show the notes data on a list 

#### The data will be stored in an SQLite database and supports CRUD Operation, i.e. Create or insert, Read or view, Update or edit and Delete or remove operations.
